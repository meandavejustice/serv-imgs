# serv-imgs

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/serv-imgs.png?downloads=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/serv-imgs)

Tiny static server that will also show you previews of all the images in your project when
you visit `/all-imgs`

see an example of the preview page [here](http://davejustice.com/serv-imgs)

## Command Line Usage

```
meandave@mainframe$ serv-imgs
```

## why?

Whenever I work on front-end projects that are image heavy I hate having to dig through directories
for pathnames or open some external tool just to view the photo. This allows me to run a basic server
for development and also view all of the images in the project without installing some crazy file-manager.
